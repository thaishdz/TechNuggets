# Hexagonal Architecture


Imagine hexagonal architecture as a pattern that separates __the core application from external services__ like _databases_ and _user interfaces_.

- The application __domain lives inside the hexagon__.
- Business logic follows __domain-driven design (DDD) principles__, which means it shouldn‚Äôt leak outside the hexagon.

- __Ports are interfaces__ through which the application interacts with external services. 
- __While Adapters are implementations of the ports__. 

This means ports define the contract or interface.
While adapters provide implementation to fulfill the contract.
